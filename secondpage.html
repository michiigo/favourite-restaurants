    	<h2>520 Sushi:</h2>
    	520 sushi is located in Brampton which is where I’m from. Although some people may argue that there are better sushi places out there, this restaurant really hits home for me. It might be the fact that I’ve been coming here for years (even before they changed their name and re-branded) but I genuinely think the food is quite delicious! This restaurant is all-you-can-eat and carries most of what typical sushi places offer (eg. rolls, sashimi, nigiri, etc.). My favourite item to order are the salmon chips which is basically raw pieces of salmon placed on top of pringle-like chips with various toppings. If you are ever in town, I recommend you come try out this place for yourself!
