    	<h2>Kenzo Ramen:</h2>
    	Although there are many different ramen restaurants scattered throughout the GTA, I personally really enjoy Kenzo which is located in Mississauga. They have quite a few different options including vegetarian. My typical go-to order is usually the miso ramen because the broth is light and fragrant. Having a hot bowl of ramen is also great for chilly days. Prior to the pandemic, they used to have customers lined up outside waiting to be seated but the wait was always worth it!
